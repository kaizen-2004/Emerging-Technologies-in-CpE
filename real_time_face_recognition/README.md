A comprehensive real-time face recognition system built with Python, InsightFace, and OpenCV that demonstrates end-to-end facial recognition capabilities.


##  Installation & Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. **Open the main.ipynb:**
   - Go to the last section
   - Run the code block on the last section
   - Or simply run:
        ```bash
        python detect.py
        ```
##  Performance

The system achieves:
- **90%+ accuracy** with proper training data
- **Real-time recognition** on CPU
- **Automatic data augmentation** (10x dataset expansion)
